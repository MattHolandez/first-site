		<P ALIGN=LEFT>	I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.</P>
		<br>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT> We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? </P>
		<br>
		<P ALIGN=LEFT>This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.</P>
